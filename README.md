# SmsSpam_Classifier

This project is a data science project that aims to develop a model for classifying SMS messages as spam or ham.

## Project Description

Spam is a major problem that can be annoying and even harmful. It is important to be able to identify spam messages so that they can be ignored or deleted. This project aims to develop a model that can accurately classify SMS messages as spam or ham.

The project uses a Jupyter notebook to train and test the model. The notebook is available in the .ipynb file. The notebook loads the dataset from the .csv file and then trains the model using a variety of machine learning techniques. The model is then tested on a separate dataset of text to evaluate its accuracy.

The project is still under development, but it has achieved promising results so far. The model has been able to accurately classify SMS messages with an accuracy of over 95%.

## How to Use the Project
The project is available on GitHub. To use the project, you will need to clone the repository to your computer. Once you have cloned the repository, you can open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook. The notebook will walk you through the steps of training and testing the model.

## Project Files
The project contains the following files:

README.md - This file provides a description of the project.
SmsSpamClassifier-checkpoint.ipynb - This Jupyter notebook trains and tests the model.
SmsSpamCollectin - This file contains the dataset or collection of spam messages that is used to train and test the model.
